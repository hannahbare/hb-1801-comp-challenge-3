# Static Comp 3 Challenge

This is the last static comp of the three part series that were assigned to the first module of Turing's Front End Program. We were given an image of what the static comp should look like and we were to build it. We did not have liberties with the layout, yet we were able to alter the copy, images, icons, and color palette. Base requirements include a basic static site with an index.html and styles.css, responsive layouts, use git and github, and push our final work to github pages. This final static comp is a part of our final portfolio to complete Mod 1.
